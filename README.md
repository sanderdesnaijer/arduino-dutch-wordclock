# Arduino dutch wordclock
Open the file in arduino, install the needed libraries (DS3231, Wire, FastLED) and run it. If you need to debug, change `isDebug` to `true` to see the correct dates.

## Requirements
- arduino 
- DS3231 clock module
- Ws2812b IP65 (don't ask me why I chose the water tight one) led light strip (13 strips of 12 lights)
- 3d printed clock (link will follow)
